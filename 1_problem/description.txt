Find the smallest number in an array

solution_1: we can sort the array in ascending order and print the 0th index number

Time_complexity for solution_1 : O(N*log(N))
Space_complexity for solution_1 : O(1)


solution_2: using a min variable

intution : we can maintain a min variable and update it whenever our current element is less min vaiable's value

aproach :
	-> create a variable and initialize it with arr[0]
	-> use for loop to compare with other elements of the array
	-> update the variable with current array element, if current array element is less than the value of min variable
	-> print the min variable

Time_complexity: O(N)
Space_complexity: O(1)
