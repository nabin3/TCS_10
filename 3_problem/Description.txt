Find second smallest and second largest number in an array

Aproach: 
	-> Take 4 varible, small,second_small,large,second_large and assigne INT_MAX to small and second_small and INT_MIN to large and second large
	-> Traverse the array and update value of small and large variale 
	-> Now again Traverse the array and update second_small and second_large varible when current element is not equal to small and large varible respectively

	Time_Complexity: O(N)
	Space_Complexity: O(1)
